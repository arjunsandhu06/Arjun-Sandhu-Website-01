			Mamostong Kangri or Mamostang Kangri, also known as K35 on the Karakoram mountain range. It is located in Ladakh, India about 30km east-southeast of the Siachen Glacier. It is the 48th tallest mountain in the world with an elevation of 7,516 meters. 
			That's taller than 20 Eiffel Towers stacked on top of each other.  
			"Kangri" refers to snow in many local languages and the mountain truly lives up to the name, as it is perpetually covered in ice and snow all year round.

			Mamostong Kangri was first climbed in 1984 by B.S Sandhu and has only had 9 ascents since then. The most recent ascent occurred in 2010 by P.C. Sahoo. Climbers must navigate steep ice slopes and unpredictable weather conditions while climbing.
			Since the first ascent only a few expeditions have been permitted due to the danger making it one of the least climbed peaks on Earth.
			The allure of the mountain is both in its physical difficulty to climb as well as its rarity as a mountain climbing achievement.

			The 1984 expedition to climb Mamostong Kangri was the most dangerous expedition attempted as it was the very first ascent.
			Cold weather, strong winds, and icy paths were just some of the dangerous conditions they had to overcome to scale the mountain.
			Overcoming these obstacles and reaching the peak of the mountain marked a big moment in the history of mountaineering in the Karakoram Mountain Range.
